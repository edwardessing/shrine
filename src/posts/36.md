I knew this would happen<br>
The end of a day should<br>
Be something to celebrate<br>
But here I am, writing<br>
Roundabouts that weave<br>
Around your desperation with<br>
Such considered contempt<br>
<br>
This time my fangs<br>
Fell in too far<br>
To force a smile<br>
Hopefully the venom<br>
Poison in my pulse<br>
Hasnâ€™t hit you yet<br>
Because the antidote<br>
Expired before we met<br>
