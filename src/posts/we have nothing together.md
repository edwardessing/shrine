You hold it like a rifle<br>
And Iâ€™m your target<br>
I try my hardest to step<br>
Outside the shadow and set<br>
Aside the separation anxiety<br>
In focus out of frame<br>
This simple game<br> 
Comes at a cost<br>
Seems so close<br> 
But feels so far off<br>
<br>
The watcher's opal eye<br> 
Makes me dizzy<br>
After the blank flash<br>
The shutter blinks<br>
And when it finally clicks<br> 
I ask myself:<br>
Were you ever here<br>
