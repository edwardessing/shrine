Bearing love and loss<br>
We pursue a path<br> 
From under the cross<br> 
That flows like a compass<br> 
Needle rolling around its rose<br>
With no wind to guide our growth<br>
<br>
Taken with this way<br>
Going to ruin on a hill<br>
I can’t run unless we stop<br>
To sit by the bridge<br>
Grace has built beside<br>
The ruin on a hill<br>
<br>
Our past spoke the same language<br>
Passing wrought sentiments through<br>
Iron gates open for the first time<br>
Now we’re trying to steal details<br>
Framed denial what looms over us<br>
Trying to understand<br>
The tension in-between<br>
<br>
I’d kill to reach it<br>
That ruin on a hill<br>
Has gotten further since<br>
Last time I sat staring<br>
Off into my hope<br>
