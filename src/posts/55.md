Do you often find yourself<br>
Swimming in the pools<br>
Of others’ gold and glory<br>
I can be so cruel but<br>
Can’t help call out a fool<br>
<br>
Building castles with black sand<br>
Caught in a landfill of poor reason<br>
May mercy bend back my hands<br>
They will blow us into ether<br>
If I refuse to listen to sellouts<br>
Standing on capsizing clouds<br>
