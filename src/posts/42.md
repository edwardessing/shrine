The lighthouse no longer<br>
Watches what we left<br>
Instead the splintering rocks<br>
Ripped sails and shipwreck<br>
Becomes a picture torn to shreds<br>
<br>
You’ve given me the exacting<br>
Task of twisting these remains<br>
To stay intact until I can catch<br>
Another side of your story<br>
<br>
Thank you<br>
