Inhaled those stacks of smoke<br>
So you could throw your voice<br>
Back behind a choir of spit<br> 
But I heard that backfire<br> 
From miles away become towers<br> 
As tall as trees and fear deeper<br>
Than the holes in my feet<br>
<br>
Iâ€™m left alone to wait<br>
Waste away in this quiet place<br>
Empire of silk walls singing<br>
Her name while I try sleeping<br>
Beside my discarded spine<br>
And paper hand of hearts<br>
<br>
Come up to sink back<br>
Between my shoulders<br>
Blade of crystal shards<br>
Careful not to make this hard<br>
Might cut yourself or go too far<br>
Lets learn to risk our minds<br> 
Love what could not be defined<br>
