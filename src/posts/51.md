Carry the distinction too far<br>
To cause any more damage<br>
Faint feeling how I wished<br>
It would tear down the bridge<br>
Built with a million bricks<br>
<br>
Cross out every option<br>
You won't notice a difference<br>
With invasion as an answer<br>
For total indifference<br>
Our light treads along<br>
The path of least resistance <br>
As existence rests on a move<br>
To make distance less than <br>
A sea between but maybe we are <br>
As useless as I’m led to believe<br>
<br>
I’ll stay in the cage<br>
Innocently watching while<br>
Your car carries us<br>
A couple more miles<br>
Don’t stop, just go<br>
Until you hit the road<br>
That ends with a smile<br>
