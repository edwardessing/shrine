Do you often find yourself<br>
Swimming in pools of<br>
Another’s gold and glory<br>
I can be so cruel but <br>
Can’t help call out a fool<br>
You refuse to listen on<br>
Top of capsizing clouds<br>
While I am caught in a landfill<br>
Of reason, building castles<br>
With salt and black sand<br>
May mercy bend back our hands<br>
And blow us away into the ether<br>
