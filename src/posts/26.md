You hold it like a rifle Iâ€™m your target<br>
I try my hardest to step<br>
Outside the shadow and set<br>
Aside the separation anxiety<br>
In focus out of frame<br>
This simple game comes at a cost<br>
Seems so close but feels so far off<br>
<br>
The watcher's opal eye makes me dizzy<br>
After the blank flash the shutter blinks<br>
And when it finally clicks I ask myself:<br>
Were you ever here<br>
