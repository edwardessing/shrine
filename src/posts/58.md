Thoughts caught up in hazy oblivion,<br>
A minefield masked by checkered<br>
Tiles where time spirals then<br>
Shatters, coating the courtyard's<br>
Sundial with shards of light<br>
<br>
Bored throwing stones<br>
Across low tides and ice<br>
Too tired to roll the red dice<br>
Tight knots I tried to untie<br>
With secateurs and knives<br>
