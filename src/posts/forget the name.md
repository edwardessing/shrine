how well do you remember a moment<br>
lying against the slanted rock wall built<br>
between the beach and the street<br>
a tenebrist townscape beneath<br>
the entrance to hell, tipped over<br>
for our viewing pleasure<br>
it was perfect<br>
we were perfect<br>
i can’t think of anything more<br>
overwhelming, other-worldly<br>
now that i think about it<br>
you probably just conjured it<br>
with your capable silence<br>
still i refused to move consumed<br>
by mere thoughts of you<br>
and how i could make you mine<br>
with a kiss, then a commotion<br>
those celestial fireworks –<br>
ribbons of ultraviolet light<br>
might burn even brighter...<br>
who knows, it never happened<br>
until after we met in the confines<br>
of my comfort zone, my bed,<br>
my total darkness<br>
could’ve been anyone<br>
giving you that pull and kiss<br>
but i’m not going to dwell on that<br>
breaking the first barrier of intimacy<br>
is a brand of awkwardness unlike<br>
anything else, like feeling<br>
a needle entering your eyelid<br>
clean, new, pure, almost<br>
a pleasure, always a pain<br>
when we got through it<br>
we were somewhere else<br>
entirely new<br>
the chase was over<br>
we had finally caught up<br>
to each other<br>
in the morning, breath,<br>
bare, i love you<br>
you knew it and<br>
maybe i did too<br>
but i was selfish, wanton<br>
when we wanted the same thing<br>
i wonder why i rushed<br>
for a familiar relief<br>
while you waited<br>
for something equally solipsistic<br>
who knows<br>
there is no strategy to love<br>
only time, patience, the virtue<br>
to forgive and never forget<br>
how much you mean to me<br>
