When what you said turns<br>
To silence the conversation<br>
Continues as an echo of<br>
Your voice in my head<br>
<br>
You don’t have to walk<br>
Beside me while I fall<br>
To pieces by the wayside<br>
<br>
I notice your reflections<br>
Clear doubt and fear<br>
By holding a mirror up<br>
To my own fractures<br>
Still I need to ask you<br>
If I should just stay away<br>
From the pier’s edge<br>
<br>
Since you left my harbour<br>
I've had a habit of using<br>
An abacus upside down<br>
To count the distance<br>
Buried between us<br>
<br>
Maybe you would rather<br>
Pair my parting words<br>
By the wayside<br>
I guess all we need<br>
To balance our years<br>
Is another set of scales<br>
