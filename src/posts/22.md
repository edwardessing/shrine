You spin the swing<br>
In small circles<br>
Twin chains twist<br>
To a taut silver spiral<br>
I taught you this game<br>
But you wonâ€™t let go<br>
So I just sit and stare<br>
At the woodchips below<br>
<br>
You wind the yarn<br>
In small circles<br>
Like your hands coiled<br>
Around my neck<br>
Forget the empty spool<br>
There are plenty more tools<br>
To hold you in my orbit<br>
