I thought you would have<br>
Held my heart by the time<br>
You went away forever<br>
But now I know it was<br>
Missing ever since the time<br>
We met in the morning<br>
<br>
That kiss in the blue cape<br>
I told you would happen<br>
Wasnâ€™t a kiss at all, only<br>
A stuttered embrace<br>
Brought on by my cold<br>
Crushing winter waves<br>
<br>
You were the softest touch<br>
And I could never guess<br>
How hard this would be<br>
