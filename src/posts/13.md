I saw you after the ice melted<br>
Thawed out to a sharp smile<br>
The most brittle bones grow<br>
Bellow the bottom of my ribcage<br>
Tear one off and tie it to a tree<br>
After making your wish to forget<br>
You can still tell me<br>
<br>
The fruit remains so pure<br>
Like the lies I fed your friends<br>
Even the devil will forgive us<br>
When we’ve made our amends<br>
