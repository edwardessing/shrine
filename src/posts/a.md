Model your world<br>
Wearing a blindfold<br> 
They tied too tightly<br>
Your city reads backwards<br>
From lands with no language<br>
You Sleep in an ivory tower<br>
While I climb its horned gate<br>
Desperately entertaining<br>
The soaking wraith with<br>
Petrol fuelled flames and<br>
Tear-stained sheets<br>
It won't stop you from suffocating<br>
Under vapour's weightless charm<br>
