Two too many arrows<br>
Piercing a tree in plain sight<br>
Wasnâ€™t sure what to aim for<br>
Only swore you asked for it<br>
<br>
Tears are running after<br>
Our pile of problems<br>
While the dead leaves glow<br>
Behind a furnace<br>
Ironed out to molten salt<br>
So you could see<br>
The hundredth part<br>
In your own faith<br>
