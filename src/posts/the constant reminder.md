This is a constant reminder:<br>
That you show off in your speech<br>
But slouch in my presence<br>
I am getting tired of finding<br>
Your blunt axe grinding<br>
My frail little teeth<br>
But maybe we both speak<br>
With the same jaw and stunted neck<br>
Folding back into a basket<br>
To watch the cloudless skies<br>
Just a dream of ceaseless fog<br>
With walkways that roll<br>
Right over our lies<br>
You tell me<br>
