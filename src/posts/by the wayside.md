When what you said<br> 
Turns to silence<br> 
The conversation continues<br>
As an echo of your voice<br>
In my head<br>
<br>
You donâ€™t have to walk<br>
Beside me while I fall<br>
To pieces by the wayside<br>
<br>
I watch your reflections<br>
Clear doubt and fear<br>
By holding a mirror up<br> 
To my own fractures<br>
<br>
Since you left my harbour<br>
I've had a habit of using<br>
An abacus upside down<br>
To count the distance<br>
Buried between us<br>
<br>
Or maybe you would rather<br>
Pair my parting words<br>
By the wayside<br>
