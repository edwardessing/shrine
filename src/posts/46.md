What's it like to be pardoned<br>
Patron saint of science<br>
Your sadness couldn't be<br>
Anymore dipped in silence<br>
Drowning patience out until<br>
Lungs fill up with bated breath<br>
Waiting won't forget about<br>
Holding hands with death<br>
In a field of hours<br>
<br>
Lunge towards the one walking<br>
Away from this and that<br>
Will keep us talking nonsense<br>
At the edge of pure bliss<br>
<br>
Better act sooner<br>
Than later like the loser<br>
Lying at my glory I paint<br>
Pure patterns of boredom<br>
