Master of my quiet<br>
Mindful breathing as I<br>
Descend the staircase<br>
That comes to a close<br>
No escape, no way out<br>
<br>
You speak with knives<br>
Cutting louder than my cries<br>
But before I can bleed out<br>
You pin five more in my side<br>
Just so you can drown<br>
In the dying sound<br>
<br>
What’s the light you worship<br>
While my age rolled<br>
Around a sapphire cemetery<br>
Becoming nothing —<br>
But a board of regrets<br>
