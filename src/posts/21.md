I remember what you said<br>
By rereading the letters<br>
We wrote to each other<br>
Reminders of better times<br>
Reasons and rhymes<br>
Or I watch our record<br>
(A rented artefact)<br>
Playing and rewinding<br>
On repeat behind<br>
A cracked screen<br>
The deleted scene of you<br>
Unscrewing the dreams<br>
And bulb inside my head<br>
After crushing its thin glass<br>
Will you remember what I said<br>
