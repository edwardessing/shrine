Inhaled a stack of smoke so<br>
You could throw your voice back<br>
Behind a choir of spit but I heard<br>
That backfire from miles away<br>
Become towers as tall as trees<br>
And fear deeper than the holes<br>
In my feet<br>
<br>
Left alone to wait<br>
Waste away in this quiet place<br>
Empire of silk walls singing<br>
Her name while I try sleeping<br>
Beside my discarded spine<br>
And paper hand of hearts<br>
<br>
Come up between my shoulders<br>
Blade of crystal shards<br>
Careful not to make this hard<br>
Might cut yourself or go too far<br>
Lets learn to risk our minds<br>
Love what we could never define<br>
