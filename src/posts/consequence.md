You can tell through the lie<br>
And laughter, I still make<br>
More mistakes than love<br>
<br>
Even when fucked and<br>
Fraught with consequence<br>
I give up<br>
Before it gets anywhere<br>
<br>
A former thief beaten<br>
By his own guilty fists<br>
Do I thank the cage<br>
That contains my agony<br>
For your entertainment<br>
<br>
This place is a prison<br>
Pulling plugs to give way<br>
To a washed-up wisdom<br>
