A sudden quake<br>
Has left us awake<br>
To severe looks<br>
We try sleeping in<br>
Your blood bath but<br>
Our bedclothes clot to<br>
A cloak of stinging night<br>
Either take it off or open<br>
The blinds because<br>
I canâ€™t see your eyes<br>
Through the back of my mind<br>
<br>
New dawn brings<br>
A hollow victory as<br>
Each swollen capillary<br>
Floods with misery<br>
Let these wounds coagulate<br>
To sudden time well spent<br>
