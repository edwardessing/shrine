Tried sleeping in your blood bath<br>
But our bedclothes clotted<br>
To a cloak of stinging night<br>
Either take it off or open the blinds<br> 
Because I canâ€™t see your eyes<br> 
Through the back of my mind<br>
<br>
New dawn brings a hollow victory<br>
As each swollen capillary<br>
Floods with misery<br>
Let these wounds coagulate<br>
To sudden time well spent<br>
