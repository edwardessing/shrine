Tried sleeping in your blood bath<br>
But our bedclothes clotted to<br>
A cloak of stinging night<br>
Either take it off or open the blinds<br> 
Because I can’t see your eyes<br> 
Through the back of my mind<br>
<br>
New dawn brings<br> 
A hollow victory, as<br>
Each swollen capillary<br>
Floods with misery.<br>
Let these wounds coagulate<br>
To sudden time well spent<br>
