You told me everything was fine<br>
But the box you used to hide your heart<br>
Was empty save for a few petals and rocks<br>
<br>
It’s like I’m standing in a garden with razor<br>
Blades of grass etching exit signs into my skin<br>
And the hedges stand so tall I can’t see<br>
The forest for the trees<br>
<br>
You have never finished a drink because<br>
You are always too busy tearing down<br>
The shrine of mirrors to trick me<br>
Into thinking you ever left<br>
