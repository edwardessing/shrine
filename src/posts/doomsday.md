You’re still wondering<br>
How I made my escape<br>
By a blanket rope<br>
Make no mistake<br>
I’m the scapegoat of rain<br>
Bows and arrows<br>
Ribboned across a desert<br>
Away from fake shelter<br>
Sent me astray<br>
To bury sin in sand<br>
Can’t handle sleeping<br>
In your torrent of demands<br>
Where dreams are seamed<br>
With fraying memories<br>
