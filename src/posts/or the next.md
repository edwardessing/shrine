Who did you deal with<br>
When I wasn't included?<br>
No one’s going to help us<br>
Consider being righteous<br>
Your weakness, slowly<br>
Lessening likeness<br>
<br>
Trapped in a factory’s hand<br>
Eating batteries to recharge<br>
An appetite for empty boxes<br>
Wrapped in invisible ropes<br>
Lining up across a lifetime<br>
<br>
Coming more to leave for less<br>
Like the costume you kept<br>
Wearing without consent<br>
Never meant to bargain<br>
For your thick skin<br>
<br>
I’ll offer you some luck<br>
Trust me it’s good<br>
Like bathing a bad mood<br>
In too hot water together<br>
With the soft flicker of<br>
A familiar flame<br>
