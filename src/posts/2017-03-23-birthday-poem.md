I didn’t know it was your birthday
But can you blame me
I never remember birthdays
I couldn’t tell you when my parents were born
My closest friends or even ex-lovers
I could tell you my brothers’
But thats because it’s in my blood
And June/July are a nice pair so
That may make it easier on my mind

I know we’re talking about march
Another day, month, year where
I’ll remember your touch and face
But i can never memorise a date
I’ll have your laugh and gaze
Locked away in my memories
Just please don’t expect me
To send you candles and a cake

Could you forgive me
I felt so rude
And for still thinking about you
Because even that seems cruel
But maybe I’ll remember next year
