I didn’t know it was your birthday<br>
But can you blame me<br>
I never remember birthdays<br>
Couldn’t tell when my parents were born,<br>
Closest friends or even ex-lovers<br>
But I could tell you about my brothers’<br>
Because they’re laced in my blood and<br>
June/July are a nice pair so<br>
That makes it easier to celebrate<br>
<br>
I know we’re talking about March<br>
Another day joins the year where<br>
I’ll remember your touch and face<br>
But could never memorise a date<br>
I’ll have your laugh and gaze<br>
Locked away in my memories<br>
Just please don’t expect me<br>
To send you candles and cake<br>
<br>
Will you forgive me? I feel so rude<br>
And for still thinking about you<br>
Because even that seems cruel<br>
Maybe I’ll remember next time<br>
