title: Birthday poem
---
I didn’t know it was your birthday<br>
But can you blame me<br>
I never remember birthdays<br>
I couldn’t tell you when my parents were born<br>
My closest friends or even ex-lovers<br>
I could tell you my brothers’<br>
But thats because it’s in my blood<br>
And June/July are a nice pair so<br>
That may make it easier to celebrate<br>
<br>
I know we’re talking about march<br>
Another day, month, year where<br>
I’ll remember your touch and face<br>
But i can never memorise a date<br>
I’ll have your laugh and gaze<br>
Locked away in my memories<br>
Just please don’t expect me<br>
To send you candles and a cake<br>
<br>
Could you forgive me<br>
I feel so rude<br>
And for still thinking about you<br>
Because even that seems cruel<br>

Maybe I’ll remember next time<br>
