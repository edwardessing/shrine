I didn’t know it was your birthday<br>
But can you blame me<br>
I never remember birthdays<br>
Couldn’t tell when my parents were born,<br>
Closest friends or even ex-lovers<br>
Yet I could tell you my brothers’<br>
Because it’s in my blood and<br>
June/July are a nice pair so<br>
That makes it easier to celebrate<br>
<br>
Another day joins the year where<br>
I’ll remember your touch and face<br>
For as long as I live<br>
But all the same<br>
I can’t memorise a date<br>
I’ll take your laugh and gaze<br>
To my grave<br>
But please don’t expect me<br>
To know when to send you<br>
Candles and cake<br>
<br>
Will you forgive me? I feel so rude<br>
And for still thinking about you<br>
Because even that seems cruel<br>
Maybe I’ll remember next time<br>
