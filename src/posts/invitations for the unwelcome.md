How does it feel to be<br>
A guest everywhere you go<br>
A distant reverie plays in<br>
Your lonely memory<br>
Why bother reminding me<br>
When we both know<br>
I am invited every time<br>
It feels like my melody just<br>
Meddles with your fragility<br>
<br>
If you care so much<br>
Push my soul down<br>
Gently to solid ground<br>
But donâ€™t act surprised when<br>
I try and bring you with me<br>
