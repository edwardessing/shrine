Bearing love and loss<br>
We pursue a path from<br>
Under the cross that flows<br>
Like a compass needle<br>
Rolling around its rose, with<br>
No wind to guide our growth<br>
<br>
Taken with this way<br>
Going to ruin on a hill<br>
Seems I can’t run unless<br>
We stop to sit by the bridge<br>
Grace has built beside<br>
The ruin on a hill<br>
<br>
Our past spoke the same language<br>
Passing wrought sentiments through<br>
Iron gates open for the first time<br>
Now we’re trying to steal details<br>
In denial of what looms over us<br>
Understanding the tension in-between<br>
<br>
I’d kill to reach it<br>
That ruin on a hill<br>
Has gotten further since<br>
The last time I sat<br>
Staring off into my hope<br>
