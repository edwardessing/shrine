Doomsday will happen at dawn<br>
Through the broken balcony<br>
I can crawl down the cloths<br>
Weapons of escape<br>
Scape goat standing before<br>
Rainbows and arrows<br>
Ribboned across the light sky<br>
Avoid the spaces that remain<br>
As I spoke sincerely<br>
Okay feeling like<br>
You're supposed to stop<br>
And stand still damnit<br>
Let's see<br>
