Stored your heart in my head to<br>
Spread your spirit through my flesh.<br>
Eventually I got tired of the weight.<br>
So I poured it down the drain<br>
Drowning our promises instead.<br>
<br>
The absence of love<br>
Left my insides out â€”<br>
Clamping every muscle<br>
To a tracery of dry veins.<br>
I am the sunken vessel,<br>
Shell without its pearl.<br>
<br>
Only responding to the view<br>
Will help you find the heart.<br>
Lost symmetry, sawn in half.<br>
Sworn to return to my spoilt body<br>
I swear to never leave again.<br>
If I do, cut off my head<br>
And keep it as a trophy.<br>
