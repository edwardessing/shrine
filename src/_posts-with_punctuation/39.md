Two too many arrows<br>
Piercing tree in plain sight<br>
Wasnâ€™t sure what to aim for<br>
Only swore you were in pain<br>
Splinters, tears are running<br>
After our pile of problems<br>
While the dead leaves glow<br>
Behind a furnace<br>
Ironed out to molten salt<br>
See the hundredth part<br>
In your own faith<br>
