Your youth is suspended<br>
Surfing the wave’s crest —<br>
Playing with scores of<br>
Crashing colour caused<br>
By innocent indifference.<br>
<br>
I try climbing to you<br>
Perched on the peak,<br>
But foam fills my callouses<br>
And I fumble then sink.<br>
<br>
If the white chaos won't<br>
Let me reach your feet<br>
Can the current at least<br>
Keep me afloat on your sea.<br>
