What's it like to be pardoned<br>
Patron saint of science<br>
Your sadness couldn't be<br>
Anymore dipped into silence<br>
Drowning patience<br>
Filling those lungs<br>
<br>
Out loud will you<br>
Lunge at the one just walking<br>
Away from this and that<br>
You keep talking won't stop<br>
Sitting sat at the edge<br>
Of pure bliss<br>
<br>
Better happen sooner<br>
Than later like the loser<br>
Lying at my glory l paint<br>
Pure patterns of boredom<br>
Assaults consumption<br>
Function, escape every<br>
Possible domination<br>
Before it can be designed<br>
For you<br>
