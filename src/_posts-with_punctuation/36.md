I knew this would happen.<br>
The end of the day should<br>
Be something to celebrate.<br>
But here I am, writing<br>
Roundabouts that weave<br>
Around your desperation with<br>
Such considered contempt.<br>
<br>
If my toxic sword makes you<br>
Cry and cringe, how could<br>
Being impaled on its blade<br>
Keep our hearts at bay?<br>
Tell me what good is a girl<br>
With her guts on the floor?<br>
<br>
Honestly this time I let<br>
My fangs fall in too far,<br>
To even force a smile.<br>
Hopefully the venom<br>
That poisoned my pulse<br>
Hasnâ€™t hit you yet,<br>
Because the antidote<br>
Expired when we first met.<br>
<br>
Next time hit the nail harder<br>
And it's possible my limbs<br>
Will walk the narrow path<br>
To your happy nowhere.<br>
