You spin the swing<br>
In small circles.<br>
Twin chains twist<br>
To a taut silver spiral.<br>
I taught you this game<br>
But you won’t let go.<br>
So I just sit and stare<br>
At the woodchips below.<br>
<br>
You wind the yarn<br>
In small circles.<br>
Like your hands coiled<br>
Around my neck.<br>
Forget the empty spool<br>
There are plenty more tools<br>
To hold you in my orbit.<br>
