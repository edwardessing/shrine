You hold it like a rifle, I’m your target.<br>
I try my hardest to step<br>
Outside the shadow and set<br>
Aside the separation anxiety.<br>
In focus out of frame.<br>
This simple game comes at a cost<br>
Seems close but feels so far off —<br>
Am I the only one suffering and lost?<br>
<br>
The watcher's opal eye<br>
Just makes me dizzy.<br>
After the blank flash<br>
The shutter blinks<br>
And when it finally clicks,<br>
I ask myself:<br>
Were you ever here?<br>
