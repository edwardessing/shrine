I saw you after the ice melted,<br>
Thawed out to a sharp smile.<br>
The most brittle bones grow<br>
Bellow the bottom of my ribcage.<br>
Tear one off and tie it to a tree.<br>
After making your wish to forget<br>
You can still tell me.<br>
<br>
The fruit remains so pure<br>
Like the lies I fed your friends,<br>
Even the devil will forgive us<br>
When weâ€™ve made our amends.<br>
