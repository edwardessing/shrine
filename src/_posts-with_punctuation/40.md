Still good<br>
Goddess of soap,<br>
I gave you a green rose<br>
And lime like you had hoped for<br>
<br>
You went by the sliding doors<br>
Barely even touching<br>
The surface<br>
Serviced goods<br>
Taken for granted<br>
And I knew this would<br>
Never happen<br>
<br>
Bear with me<br>
For just five minutes<br>
At a time when nothing will<br>
Ever happen<br>
<br>
Wait on standby<br>
Let silent contemplation<br>
Be your gift<br>
