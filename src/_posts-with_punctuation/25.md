Peel back the plastic curtain<br>
And prop yourself up on<br>
The stainless steel bench.<br>
There was something real here,<br>
Can you smell the slaughter?<br>
You butchered your chances<br>
Digging out my throat.<br>
Now it's someone elseâ€™s turn<br>
To devour, gorge away gore,<br>
Neither of us could bargain for<br>
The despair at your demise.<br>
Our desire came at a far greater price.<br>
