You model your world<br>
Wearing a blindfold<br>
They tied up too tightly.<br>
Your city reads backwards<br>
From a land with no language.<br>
Sleep in the ivory tower and<br>
I will climb its horned gate.<br>
Blame smoke soaked wraiths<br>
And petrol fuelled flames<br>
That you desperately entertain<br>
With tear-stained sheets.<br>
It won't stop you from suffocating<br>
Under vapour's weightless charm.<br>
