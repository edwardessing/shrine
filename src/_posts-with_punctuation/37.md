At the centre of my room<br>
There’s this ladder that<br>
Stands beneath a string<br>
Swinging from the ceiling.<br>
When I climb the steps<br>
To sleep beside her,<br>
I wonder why she clings<br>
To my throat so tightly —<br>
Taking my breath away<br>
Without even a word<br>
Between the wind.<br>
<br>
Please, won't you let go?<br>
The whiplash has left<br>
Enough of these mark<br>
I can never mend.<br>
