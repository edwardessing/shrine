How does it feel to be<br>
A guest everywhere you go?<br>
A distant reverie plays in<br>
Your lonely memory.<br>
Why bother reminding me<br>
When we both know<br>
I am invited every time.<br>
It feels like my melody just<br>
Meddles with your fragility.<br>
<br>
If you care so much<br>
Push my soul down<br>
Gently to solid ground.<br>
But don’t act surprised when<br>
I try and bring you with me.<br>
