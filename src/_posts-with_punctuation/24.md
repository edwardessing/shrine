Stop before I start,<br>
You can’t tell if we are<br>
Nearer or further apart.<br>
Tearing from starvation<br>
Our banquet is doomed<br>
To a coy cry for salvation:<br>
We will perish centuries after<br>
The still life centring this room.<br>
Sorry for spilling wine<br>
On your best dress, but<br>
The beast bit the apple<br>
Before I could contest.<br>
You pray and you plead<br>
But my taste is just like his —<br>
The rot is as sacred as<br>
The ring around your face.<br>
My rupture won't remove<br>
The faintest flicker of faith.<br>
