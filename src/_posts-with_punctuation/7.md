Sand tears our sight and<br>
Stones bust our voices.<br>
Nothing gets through here<br>
Kind of like a dam.<br>
Our senses no longer rest<br>
By death’s buried mess.<br>
Instead gazing at slate<br>
Embellished with our names<br>
To pass today’s thick haze —<br>
Drown out the coffin<br>
Once more before<br>
Calling this a day.<br>
