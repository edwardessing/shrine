stay or leave
keeping up appearances
for how long, to what extent
not a secret to be kept
share temporary, worth more than
a bathroom break
 
push me away
try to fit me in, i’m not flattered
i won't impose, my walls rise
i'll never force these gates
clinging, a sinking familiarity

//

don't want to toss this aside
maybe we could have grab hold on mutual
but it hasn't happened yet-- if we're stuck
it's too late

//

they were right, i can't control
losing the vibrance reserved for
permanence, identity draining
homesick for God

//

potent + beautiful
can mysterious be reduced
to mere play + cheap talk
your casual skin reveals a dark
interior, I'm scared of dropping
in -- unable to crawl out

//

how it started

It's when I think of you that I begin
to craft carefully unintelligible motions
Woven in delicate forms so as not
to be misread, misinterpreted.
Patience wills the thoughtful slurs
Openly I begin to share secrets
held only for myself until now,
Until you.
 
And if you ever ask me to stop
this avalanche becoming a burden
I'll hold back, I can be bilingual
We've learnt it before, we can
practice it again.

//

unstable sometimes dim
approaching my routine interrupted
as I watch the memory like a movie letting
the scene play out fully in a world
secluded too often
 
I haven't forgotten / I remember

//

the dream in which you didn’t exist

I watched comfortably, drifting uncommitted
from afar these friends enjoying company
like I enjoy solitude coming together
Occasionally I didn't search for you, how do I
look for someone I've never encountered?
but your persistence the antidote
we can't forget
 
Found
a disconnect where you were lost
in a space between stages of realities
you and I dream alone.
 
Under warm beams escaping the grasp
of drapes pulled impatient waking
Silently myself nestled in a stranger's
cradle realizing again it's you have
been here all long.

//

cutting up an apple distorts
its form to our convenient likings.
teeth marks exercise youth
with each chipping away carving
gradual forms until naked it stands
at its core the seeds ready to rattle
out discarded, disintegrated
seemingly dead buried at once
it births another life.
 
you can't count the number of apples
in a seed.
you can't count the number of lives
impacted in a being.

//

don't put your hope in me, I'll fail you
feelings come and go though my love
for you will never change.
it heightens  then settles
quietly--
it still burns.
 
what truly matters?
don't put it off or
concern yourself with everyday
matters, perspective matters

//

thank you for being a temporary blessing, one
I can't expect you to be or not
it's not time-- your heart nudges as you brush
tendrils aside / tucked
 
Exposed I can hear you, I'm listening.
be careful how you say you're still here
we don't know what we want, just hoping
these estimates amount to all it could
Can be.

//

suddenly—I find it funny too

it gets easier.
humorous.. right? how
does time keep going despite all
Efforts to keep it leashed
in our limited understanding

//

15 Feb 2014

snowflakes smothered me like
the first kisses you impressed
on my freckles.

//

you'd think the more time spent apart
from another creates distance but
the breathing room has only inflamed
my ardor for you.
 
the longer we spend apart the sooner
I see you again.
loving you, opened my eyes to brokenness.

//

Let it go, unclench the need to control these fears
and maybe, maybe (hope dines here)
these open hands will receive
Tenfold in the flowering of its return

//

sad stories

a planned falling-away
count plus another month
just as the dust settles, your contact plays
a note too soon. this song doesn't sound so nice
off tempo.
 
unless you have something worthwhile to say
please don't. lukewarm tea, sucks.
 
for the intensities overtake in my sleep --
confusion on both sides we misinterpret
language is a barrier
I don't like to hide-and-seek.
 
like the twenty-third,
in our separation a theme replays
sad, but relieved.

//

(not) the end
 
everything behind-the-scenes
eventually shows itself as
truth. suddenly
an urgency to live intentional
and expectant.
 
apart from time God sees
your beginning, your end
& as every end becomes a means
perhaps I am just a means.
 
that's ok, it's all good.
