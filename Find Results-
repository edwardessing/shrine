    7  A sudden dip on steady seas<br>
    8  Sends our eyes north and ship south<br>
    9: There is no exit this time around<br>
   10  Haul the anchor heave the windlass<br>
   11  You always knew the hull<br>

    8  As breaking roads of bleeding lines<br>
    9  Leave a chasm of strangled cords<br>
   10: Drowning in hot water<br>

   12  The reflection is no more,<br>

    7: Forget our unfaltering harmony<br>
    8  Lets shave this tree trunk together<br>
    9: With the instrument of your will<br>
   10  My wide open eyes<br>
   11: Can collect some sawdust<br>
   12  Do you see yourself now?<br>
   13  A shepherd with a wolf’s heart,<br>
   14: Sold to your blistered soul<br>
   15  Please don't lead me astray,<br>
   16: I only need what you want from me<br>

    7  Is this really worth the trouble?<br>
    8  The faucets are leaking chalk<br>
    9: Over our sacred gestures<br>
   10  Move your elbows off the table<br>
   11  And watch for a rear blur —<br>
   12  As one hundred dark roses<br>
   13: Sear to splintering charcoal<br>

    7  This is a constant reminder:<br>
    8  That you show off in your speech<br>
    9: But slouch in my presence<br>
   10  I am getting tired of finding<br>
   11  Your blunt axe grinding<br>
   12: My frail little teeth<br>
   13: But maybe we both speak<br>
   14  With the same jaw and stunted neck<br>
   15  Folding back into a basket<br>
   16: To watch the cloudless skies<br>
   17  Just a dream of ceaseless fog<br>
   18  With walkways that roll<br>
   19: Right over our lies<br>
   20: You tell me<br>

    7  I saw you after the ice melted,<br>
    8: Thawed out to a sharp smile<br>
    9  The most brittle bones grow<br>
   10: Bellow the bottom of my ribcage<br>
   11: Tear one off and tie it to a tree<br>
   12  After making your wish to forget<br>
   13: You can still tell me<br>
   14  <br>
   15  The fruit remains so pure<br>
   16  Like the lies I fed your friends,<br>

   10  We try sleeping in<br>
   11  Your blood bath, but<br>
   12  Our bedclothes clot to
   13: A cloak of stinging night<br>
   14  Either take it off or open<br>
   15  The blinds, because<br>
   16  I can’t see your eyes<br>
   17: Through the back of my mind<br>
   18  <br>
   19  New dawn brings<br>
   20  A hollow victory, as<br>
   21  Each swollen capillary<br>
   22: Floods with misery<br>
   23  How about we allow these<br>
   24  Shallow wounds coagulate<br>

    7  Daggers grow from roses<br>

   10  To push it straight back<br>
   11: Into your open chest<br>
   12  Before you can speak<br>
   13  The protection and pain<br>
   14: Holds us both together<br>

    7  Crossing keys over a crown<br>
    8: Hanging down below her brow<br>
    9  She wraps weighted wrists<br>
   10: Around an uneven waist<br>
   11  Can you throw the gauntlet<br>
   12  Without running away?<br>
   13  Can you bear the pressure<br>
   14  Without wearing the armour?<br>
   15: Your steel doesn't conceal fear<br>

    7  Our razor words cut vines<br>

   11  If we leave right now
   12  We can watch the dissolve<br>

    7  Between two tunnels of muted mint light<br>
    8: There is a private lane we share<br>
    9  Our faded thoughts colour<br>
   10: A freeway's rush of energy<br>
   11  Catching up on running away<br>
   12: The past stays present<br>
   13  Just wait and watch me<br>
   14: While I distract myself<br>
   15  Counting every link in this chain<br>

    7  Driving one thousand winds<br>

    9  I cannot be without you<br>
   10: And your guided knife<br>
   11  Lean to the cost and calls<br>
   12: Of callous, careless, lost lovers<br>
   13  Sorry for being too busy<br>
   14: Fending off my own freedom<br>

    8  By rereading the letters<br>
    9: We wrote to each other<br>
   10  Reminders of better times,<br>
   11: Reasons and rhymes<br>
   12  Or I watch our record<br>
   13  (A rented artefact)<br>

   17  The deleted scene of you<br>
   18  Unscrewing the dreams<br>
   19: And bulb inside my head<br>
   20  After crushing its thin glass<br>
   21  Will you remember what I said?<br>

    9  Twin chains twist<br>
   10: To a taut silver spiral<br>
   11  I taught you this game<br>
   12: But you won’t let go<br>
   13  So I just sit and stare<br>
   14: At the woodchips below<br>
   15  <br>
   16  You wind the yarn<br>
   17: In small circles<br>
   18  Like your hands coiled<br>
   19: Around my neck<br>
   20  Forget the empty spool<br>
   21  There are plenty more tools<br>
   22: To hold you in my orbit<br>

/Users/edward/Sites/shrine/src/posts/23.md:
    8  A guest everywhere you go?<br>
    9  A distant reverie plays in<br>
   10: Your lonely memory<br>
   11  Why bother reminding me<br>
   12  When we both know<br>
   13: I am invited every time<br>
   14  It feels like my melody just<br>
   15: Meddles with your fragility<br>
   16  <br>
   17  If you care so much<br>
   18  Push my soul down<br>
   19: Gently to solid ground<br>
   20  But don’t act surprised when<br>
   21: I try and bring you with me<br>

    7  Stop before I start,<br>
    8  You can’t tell if we are<br>
    9: Nearer or further apart<br>
   10  Tearing from starvation<br>
   11  Our banquet is doomed<br>
   12  To a coy cry for salvation:<br>
   13  We will perish centuries after<br>
   14: The still life centring this room<br>
   15  Sorry for spilling wine<br>
   16  On your best dress, but<br>
   17  The beast bit the apple<br>
   18: Before I could contest<br>
   19  You pray and you plead<br>
   20  But my taste is just like his —<br>
   21  The rot is as sacred as<br>
   22: The ring around your face<br>
   23  My rupture won't remove<br>
   24: The faintest flicker of faith<br>

    7  Peel back the plastic curtain<br>
    8  And prop yourself up on<br>
    9: The stainless steel bench<br>
   10  There was something real here,<br>
   11  Can you smell the slaughter?<br>
   12  You butchered your chances<br>
   13: Digging out my throat<br>
   14  Now it's someone else’s turn<br>
   15  To devour, gorge away gore,<br>
   16  Neither of us could bargain for<br>
   17: The despair at your demise<br>

    7: You hold it like a rifle, I’m your target<br>
    8  I try my hardest to step<br>
    9  Outside the shadow and set<br>
   10: Aside the separation anxiety<br>
   11: In focus out of frame<br>
   12  This simple game comes at a cost<br>
   13  Seems close but feels so far off —<br>

   15  <br>
   16  The watcher's opal eye<br>

   11  Show me the seasons,<br>

   11: On your maiden bed<br>
   12  I will hear your plead,<br>

   14  Balance the apple<br>

    7  Not at all what I need<br>
    8: But what I always wanted<br>
    9  As vital as my house<br>

   11  By a ghost from your grave<br>
   12  And the scissors you distorted,<br>
   13  Slowly cutting the pages<br>
   14: From the books we never sorted<br>

    7  You fold torn paper<br>
    8  Cut corners while I kiss<br>

   10  Blood always tastes<br>
   11  Better when it drips<br>

   15  Secrets we trap<br>
   16  Beneath bleeding leaves<br>
   17: Turns to sap and grief<br>

    7: Breaking rank and bending file<br>
    8  The chase is finally over, and<br>
    9  Now you stand in harm's way<br>
   10: With an unknowing smile<br>
   11  Like when hapless prey buckles<br>
   12: Before the jaws of its maker<br>
   13  You faked the left too late and<br>
   14: Spent your strength for nothing<br>

    7  Stored your heart in my head to<br>
    8: Spread your spirit through my flesh<br>
    9: Eventually I got tired of the weight<br>
   10  So I poured it down the drain<br>
   11: Drowning our promises instead<br>
   12  <br>
   13  The absence of love<br>
   14  Left my insides out —<br>
   15  Clamping every muscle<br>
   16: To a tracery of dry veins<br>
   17  I am the sunken vessel,<br>
   18: Shell without its pearl<br>
   19  <br>
   20  Only responding to the view<br>
   21: Will help you find the heart<br>
   22: Lost symmetry, sawn in half<br>
   23  Sworn to return to my spoilt body<br>
   24: I swear to never leave again<br>
   25  If I do, cut off my head<br>
   26: And keep it as a trophy<br>

   13  I try climbing to you<br>
   14  Perched on the peak,<br>
   15  But foam fills my callouses<br>
   16: And I fumble then sink<br>
   17  <br>
   18  If the white chaos won't<br>
   19  Let me reach your feet<br>
   20  Can the current at least<br>

    8  To silence, the conversation<br>
    9  Continues as an echo —<br>
   10: Your voice in my head<br>
   11  <br>
   12  You don’t have to walk<br>
   13  Beside me, while I fall<br>
   14: To pieces by the wayside<br>
   15  <br>
   16  I notice your reflections<br>
   17  Clear doubt and fear<br>
   18  By holding a mirror up<br>
   19: To my fractured notions<br>
   20  Still, I need to ask you<br>
   21  If I should just stay away<br>

   26  An abacus upside down<br>
   27  To count the distance<br>
   28: Buried between us<br>
   29  <br>
   30  Maybe you would rather<br>
   31  Pair my parting words<br>
   32: Along the wayside<br>
   33  I guess all we need<br>
   34  To balance our years<br>

    8  The end of the day should<br>
    9: Be something to celebrate<br>
   10  But here I am, writing<br>
   11  Roundabouts that weave<br>
   12  Around your desperation with<br>
   13: Such considered contempt<br>
   14  <br>
   15  If my toxic sword makes you<br>

   22  Honestly this time I let<br>
   23  My fangs fall in too far,<br>
   24: To even force a smile<br>
   25  Hopefully the venom<br>
   26  That poisoned my pulse<br>
   27  Hasn’t hit you yet,<br>
   28  Because the antidote<br>
   29: Expired when we first met<br>
   30  <br>
   31  Next time hit the nail harder<br>
   32  And it's possible my limbs<br>
   33  Will walk the narrow path<br>

   11  When I climb the steps<br>
   12  To sleep beside her,<br>

   15  Taking my breath away<br>
   16  Without even a word<br>
   17: Between the wind<br>
   18  <br>
   19  Please, won't you let go?<br>
   20  The whiplash has left<br>
   21  Enough of these mark<br>

   11  My white flag and red cape<br>
   12  Are useless in this truce,<br>

   11  Our senses no longer rest<br>
   12: By death’s buried mess<br>
   13  Instead gazing at slate<br>
   14  Embellished with our names<br>

   16  Drown out the coffin<br>
