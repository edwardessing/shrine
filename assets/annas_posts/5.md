how it started

It's when I think of you that I begin
to craft carefully unintelligible motions
Woven in delicate forms so as not
to be misread, misinterpreted.
Patience wills the thoughtful slurs
Openly I begin to share secrets
held only for myself until now,
Until you.
Â 
And if you ever ask me to stop
this avalanche becoming a burden
I'll hold back, I can be bilingual
We've learnt it before, we can
practice it again.
