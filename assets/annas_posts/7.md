the dream in which you didn’t exist

I watched comfortably, drifting uncommitted
from afar these friends enjoying company
like I enjoy solitude coming together
Occasionally I didn't search for you, how do I
look for someone I've never encountered?
but your persistence the antidote
we can't forget
 
Found
a disconnect where you were lost
in a space between stages of realities
you and I dream alone.
 
Under warm beams escaping the grasp
of drapes pulled impatient waking
Silently myself nestled in a stranger's
cradle realizing again it's you have
been here all long.
