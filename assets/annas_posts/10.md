thank you for being a temporary blessing, one
I can't expect you to be or not
it's not time-- your heart nudges as you brush
tendrils aside / tucked
Â 
Exposed I can hear you, I'm listening.
be careful how you say you're still here
we don't know what we want, just hoping
these estimates amount to all it could
Can be.
