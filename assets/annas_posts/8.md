cutting up an apple distorts
its form to our convenient likings.
teeth marks exercise youth
with each chipping away carving
gradual forms until naked it stands
at its core the seeds ready to rattle
out discarded, disintegrated
seemingly dead buried at once
it births another life.
Â 
you can't count the number of apples
in a seed.
you can't count the number of lives
impacted in a being.
