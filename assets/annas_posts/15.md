sad stories

a planned falling-away
count plus another month
just as the dust settles, your contact plays
a note too soon. this song doesn't sound so nice
off tempo.
 
unless you have something worthwhile to say
please don't. lukewarm tea, sucks.
 
for the intensities overtake in my sleep --
confusion on both sides we misinterpret
language is a barrier
I don't like to hide-and-seek.
 
like the twenty-third,
in our separation a theme replays
sad, but relieved.
