How are we inspired by what we love and what we hate. The light is dim in this casket of black. Its metal bleeding darkness.

Radiance melting through beams of ultra light. Screens and shadow creating a mesh.

The blood runs rivers through every crevice every hole every window

Lightning daggers fly down like rays dancing across the abyss

Frameworks of milk white cages. Scattered like dust on marble

Connections fixing themselves in place. Fastening a belt that's too small.

Battle and lock. Bash and stand up again. We will keep going against ourselves until nothing but the bones and soul remains.

When we have all left the room. Someone needs to turn off that light and let the shadows back in. Allow those outcasts to re enter. Something that we never wanted to have to see or confront again. Like legs like arms. Bodies on bodies. Folding in such a quick succession. It's no more another being as it is another existence. The second layer.

Snatching light and lure of darkness. Poles and beams cast in the shiniest metals. Their silvery flesh melts to expose the iron core. So strong and pulsing like a needle trying and push its way through powder. 

Eventually the key just locks. And rolls back into place. But a hint of light always peers through. A simple maze of leaves and ash. We return to it. We come back to it. To look.

To peer. To vanish. Into nothing again.

We're squinting at relatives who can barely recognise their own faces. Hollowed vessels where the light only flickers and fades.

When the rolling wave of darkness comes back around. Its curtains will be hoisted high like palace ships. The arches strain your sight.

Those depths yield the greatest heights. Mountains become canyons of frost and sand. Those shallow pits where we scraped our knees and buried our bodies. Falling forwards back again and again.

Your figures come close together. Glaring and wasting away in front of me. Endlessly marching to oblivions gate and my onslaught of killing fields. You will never understand that system of oppression and defeat because you are one with it. At peace with her doors. And her choice of carpets and lines and light and love and you.

It's too hot to touch but too cold without it around. Ice lakes and snowfall. The faintest sense of rain. Trickling downward. Along the branch along the tree along the string that is tied up in knots and locks. The thread. Our threads. Of beads. Of sweat. Of heat and hot. Coal and fire. Black and the cracking embers.

Like chipping paint from a wall. Peeling its layers back to reveal scars and sadness and sorrow. And it sucks and pulls and brings us in. Until we are all hugging ourselves. So tightly. You are suffocating.

Why are we ashamed of this back. This neck this fold this fake this real or unreal gloss. So thick sometimes it pops. And bursts into screaming waves and Violent pools of hatred. When we confide when we call beg ask plead cry whatever. Whatever are we looking for? What looks back at us? How do they sense our unhappiness our barren insides. Out across the road the same thing is happening. Same day. Same minute. Same fragment. That puzzle has been solved but it only leads to a bigger problem. And like the last this will be our last. And her last and our fathers mother brother sisters family and enemy. Those very same we fight we kiss with blades and beacons and warnings. The alarms are sounding off. It's deafening. I can't hear you can't hear. Believe me none of us can. The boat is upside down. The Stars have become our sea. The place where we lie to rest one final time is opening upon us and within our souls deepest Desire to become a whole of something again.

That we don't need to paint the brush or fill it in. We just tolerate it. Numb to the war of infinity that is happening inside us. Beginning end and middle. What are these icons of history but collapsing statues. Broken busts. And split heads. What is that triumph but a pyramid of axes. The sky. Then a basket. Those clouds. The wood. Paper thin.

What bridges do we need to keep building just to know we were neighbours all along.

Did we kill our lords before their masters killed themselves. Or ourselves? Our sleeves are the same. My rings fit her fingers. I just need her hand on my plate.

Sometimes that knife comes too close. And before it's too late it's the next day. Or evening. And when we come back, we are still lying there motionlessly. Those tides are on loop. You can't stop what's already happening and has happened so many fucking times before. You don't understand! We don't understand!? Who started this. Who is stopping it. Press that door into a lock. Barricade it with all this furniture we bought together but never used. Otherwise there was nothing we could do about it. 

That box will unpack itself. Into your brand new room. Your brand new walls. That new beginning/start whatever the hell they want you to call it. They want you to see it as much as you want them to look at themselves. That mirror can only go both ways.

I think we can both drown out that coffin one more time before we finally call it a day and go back to sleep in it.

Who the fuck cares about looking at themselves when they can look for someone else. What measure what metric can guide us? That ruler is just a blunt sword.

Do we really enjoy looking backwards, before. It is better and it is definitely worse. The absolute bottom of the barrel of Apples is rot not fruit. 

And that's why the past can stay in your present and my streams can mix with your hair and we can crash against any beach on this ocean.

Those white dunes where sand scratches our eyes it's so dam there. And this is the last place a dam can exist because we're on one plane. And you're standing there. Next to a shadow. That blank slate gave us the names by which we know each other today. 
Dearest, closest. Nothing gets through here. Kind of like a dam.

Is the realisation the joy. Or is something wrong. That isn't posing that's hiding. I think most would choose love. The selection was always in your favour anyway. Why does it give me so much more pleasure seeing yourself with yourself rather than myself.

I think You are alone now.

The rally of those high and wise speeches are no different to the small pictures left out of the frame. When we do adjust and we see it again. Will the visor blaze purple lights?

If it's something we want others to see then why don't we show ourselves. I am from a lineage of people who no longer know their own language. That same pendulum slicing its own time. That journey belonged there in the first place. It fits perfectly. Just like you.

Do we really want to learn to love old things again. The new sounds the same because we've heard it before obviously. We were in oblivion.

Why do we want to keep hold of this. This is killing us right? That's both of our bloods. We chose the same red and right now we're no longer standing we're swimming in it. It's up to your neck and its down my throat. And one of us better start coughing or otherwise we might just choke.

The words and rhymes are familiar because we said it together forever before. And your eternity is the view, I'm just cleaning the glass.

You show and I will tell you how you have become me. How you have come before me. I'm kneeling at your toes. In prayer?

Is that you. Yes.

It has taken something from my spiral to see your control. 

Is that the way it should be? No.
