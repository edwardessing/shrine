Five brown leaves made of clay. They formed before you. Sleeping still until broken into millions. It won't hurt you but it might kill them.

The grey wash above an emerald plane chills my skin. The wind's cracked whip, the rusted pike, a yellow moon and violet light. I will close the fence with you on the otherside. We can go together.

You've kept it on your windowsill. Looking outwards and inwards, like a small tank of mirrors. Does it align with your shoulders. Do you watch over each other? That window is always closed.

We prod it with sticks. And it pours out a stone ruin. Once a temple now just ash. You are something I can no longer hold.

I recognise that pink black bow. You can untie that diamond glow in the crystal cave. The dark path cuts like a glass bridge. I will open that innocent gate.

I recognise that pink black bow. You can untie that diamond glow in the crystal cave. I will open that innocent gate. The dark joins like a glass bridge.

What were you hoping for? I was ready but you never showed up. Still floating in your vault of heaven.

You shaped this globe wearing a blindfold. Your handprints are everywhere but the cities read backwards and sand fills the sea.
