On a side note.

As long as we tell them what we definitely don't want to hear ourselves. Wouldn't that be the worst? Only for you. That nightmare is meant to haunt you. That spider is meant to be scary. You've been telling yourself that before you could even listen.

Can you steer. Can feel me this time. You can fix the mirror that I broke. I didn't mean to drop it. I mean it was falling all along wasn't it? I can't stop that train as much as i want to stand in front of it. In front of you. So I can be the one to take the final blow. Everything. And those memories will weigh me down until I can float again.

The sound of me drowning was the song of you waking up. Why is it echoing? Because when we built this chamber I said I wanted to hear our song forever. It's quiet for you. It's unbearable for me.

That inspiration wasn't me copying I was just trying to capture everything. Perfectly. Wouldn't you like that?

I was Edward the confessor way before you were Helen of Troy. And that war you're about to wage will kill us all. The war of roses and rings were just marks of devotion. You will go through the front door and i will exit the trap. Who knows if it's going to be the same room.

Those seasons changed in reverse I'm pretty sure. Didn't you see that? Your summer green was my winter sea.

I wrote something and I have no idea who to share it with. Who wants to hear it? They've got scars of their own...but your wounds are still bleeding. It's not a competition either of us wanted to win anyway.

That's the same verse sung in a lower key that's way too high for a safe climb.

So I might need that rope back. And I can fit it around my own neck this time. Because at this point or height we might as well just jump. And That swing you wanted won't be so sweet.

We become strangers to ourselves because we forgot. Our broken memory. Our lighthouse was not looking for you. And Those sharp black rocks and your shipwreck was a painting I hung on the wall behind it. Does that sound painful to you? Does that twist become a bend and that splinter a stake. You are what will keep me alive but I'm sorry. I must kill you.

But before I do I will drain you. Everything you are and will be I will take away. I will take it and drown myself in it. I will take you and drown myself in you.

Do you want to explain to me what I am trying my hardest to unlearn. Can I love you again like I never did before.

That church garden with the blooming roses was also a graveyard. And that's where we met and it's also where we will be buried. Your tears will give water so those plants can grow again. Those vines can cover our grave. So we can lie here forever.

It's really not that hard but how soft did you want it. Are these sheets steel or silk.

The moment I see love, you see an endless nothing. You look for only a second while I see nothing else. You like that cycle because it's a wheel you are spinning.
