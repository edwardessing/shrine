Your dream will only happen when she wants it to. That's how dreams work. You have to be in her head first. Leave your throne of hands and descend the overcast tower. A perfect gift settles on the ground beneath. Perched and ready, cracked and discarded. Protect but never open.

She shakes because of you. She cries because of you. Her laugh, her stare leads you up those stairs into her room. Her domain, her heart, your soul.

A painting of her. Not a detour but a dead end. What you see is not what she sees. What you see in that golden frame is out of focus. Lay down that rifle. That sniper scope has seen enough. Putting up your arms is like lifting yourself out of hell.

We are in love with whatever we could never see ourselves being.

You will never run out of tissues. Your breath will stop before they end. Pinch your tears before you start crying blood. Perfect stillness will never stand forever. 

You've probably met her before. You would say no. It was like she knew all your secrets just as you knew every last one of hers.

You can watch it your way. Start stop the end the middle in that order out of order repeat. You cannot live this way. Only watch. And wait. And it will never come without love.

If she ever came to your lap. Approached while you were at ease. She would be crying not smiling. For your talent was to keep her level. Keep her at your height, not push her back down to her knees. That's your carpet of soil, and those are her candles. beads of stars scattered across the darkness. The wax mixes into lava. That floor is burning our feet. We should get out of here. The original sin was not thinking about you at all.
